# odin-recipes
Prosjekt odin-recipes
It’s time to practice all of the HTML knowledge you have acquired. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes..




When you’re building your project, you will probably end up doing several 

git add + git commit 

cycles before being ready to push it up to GitHub with 

git push origin main.

When writing code, it’s considered best practice to commit early and often. Commit every time you have a meaningful change in the code. This will create a timeline of your progress and show that your finished code didn’t appear out of nowhere.

After you have entered git push origin main, switch over to your browser and open your repository on GitHub. You should now see all the files you just pushed.

Okay, that’s enough Git for the moment – time to actually build stuff!
